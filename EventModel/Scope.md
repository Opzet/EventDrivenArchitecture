Types of extension that you can make include adding menu commands, adding handlers for drag and double-click gestures, and rules that are triggered when particular types of values or relationships change. The extensions can be packaged as a Visual Studio Integration Extension (VSIX) and distributed to other users.

Text Template Transformation

MSDK lets you develop a model quickly in the form of a domain-specific language (DSL). You begin by using a specialized editor to define a schema or abstract syntax together with a graphical notation. From this definition, VMSDK generates:

A model implementation with a strongly-typed API that runs in a transaction-based store.

A tree-based explorer.

A graphical editor in which users can view the model or parts of it that you define.

Serialization methods that save your models in readable XML.

Facilities for generating program code and other artifacts using text templating
