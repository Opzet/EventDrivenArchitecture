# Event Annotator: Code-First Approach

**Intent:** Documentation from a single source of truth â€” the [annotated] code

The **Event Annotator** is a **code-first tool** designed to help you annotate your source code in a way that automatically generates up-to-date documentation. This documentation is then rendered in the **Event Viewer**.

By focusing on source code annotations, this approach ensures that your documentation is always synchronized with your codebase. This streamlines the process of documenting event-driven architectures, making them visually clear and easy to understand.

Unlike the traditional model-first approach, which focuses on designing events upfront, the **Event Annotator** simplifies the process of integrating third-party event-driven components. It provides a more straightforward method for managing and visualizing complex event-driven integrations within your architecture.

## Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Generate and Save Event Documentation (MDX Catalog)
- Annotate your C# source code with event details.
- Use the **bootstrapped** process to generate an **MDX documentation catalog** from the annotated code.
- The catalog is generated using the `eventcatalog build` command.
- The output is a comprehensive **EventCatalog** containing event definitions, structures, and other relevant documentation in MDX format.

### Step 2: Bootstrap the Event Catalog
- The bootstrapped event catalog is automatically consumed by the `eventcatalog build` command.
- This command processes your annotated C# code and generates the event documentation, ready to be served and viewed.

### Step 3: Compile and Serve the Event Catalog
Once bootstrapped, the catalog is ready to be compiled and served:
- You can compile the **EventCatalog** for visualization purposes, generating a static site that can be hosted anywhere.
- Use the following command to build the static site:

  ```bash
  eventcatalog build
  ```

- The **EventCatalog** app provides a set of powerful scripts to help you:
  - Generate the documentation catalog.
  - Serve the catalog locally or deploy it to any hosting platform.

## Key Features

- **Code-First Approach:** Focuses on generating documentation directly from the annotated code, ensuring your documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.
- **Simplifies Integration:** The Event Annotator is designed to integrate third-party event-driven components seamlessly into your existing architecture.
- **Automated Documentation Generation:** Once your code is annotated, the Event Annotator handles the automatic generation of event-driven architecture (EDA) documentation.
- **Flexibility in Hosting:** The static site generated by the EventCatalog can be hosted anywhere, providing flexibility in how you deploy and visualize your event documentation.

## Example Usage

1. **Annotate Your C# Source Code**
   - Add event annotations in your code base to describe your events, handlers, and any additional metadata that should appear in the documentation.

2. **Generate the Event Catalog**
   - Use the `eventcatalog build` command to generate the MDX documentation catalog from the annotated source code.

   ```bash
   eventcatalog build
   ```

3. **Host and Visualize the Documentation**
   - Serve the static site generated from the catalog or deploy it to a platform of your choice to visualize your event documentation.

By following this process, you ensure that your event-driven architecture is documented effectively and consistently, directly from your source code annotations.

## Benefits

- **Real-time Documentation Sync:** Documentation is always in sync with your codebase, reducing the risk of outdated or inaccurate documentation.
- **Easy Integration of Third-Party Components:** Integrate external event-driven services and components without disrupting your existing architecture.
- **Clarity and Visual Representation:** The generated documentation offers a clear, visual representation of your event-driven architecture, making it easier for developers to understand and work with.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Since the documentation is automatically generated from the source code, maintaining it becomes much easier as your architecture evolves.

### Get Started

To get started with the Event Annotator, make sure your C# project is set up with the appropriate annotations. Then, use the EventCatalog tools to generate and visualize your event documentation.
